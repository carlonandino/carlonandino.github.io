<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> Hello again. Here are a couple things about me. I am a big gamer and I'm usually playing something on my
 pc when I have free time. Right now I am focusing on the game Escape from Tarkov but I play basically everything.
 Apart from gaming I like going to the gym or walking my dogs for exercise. I'm usually listening to Amity Affliction
 or Bring Me the Horizon or a lot of other rock, rap, or metal groups. As for movies and shows, I am into all the
 marvel, superhero, and other nerdy stuff but really most movies and shows are fun to watch. Finally, I would like
 to someday test and maybe even make video games for a living since they are a big part of my life. </p>
